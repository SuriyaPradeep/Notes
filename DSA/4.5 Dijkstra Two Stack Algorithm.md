### What is Dijkstra Two Stack Algorithm
Dijkstra's Two-Stack Algorithm is a simple and classic algorithm used for evaluating arithmetic expressions. It was proposed by Edsger Dijkstra, a Dutch computer scientist. The algorithm employs two stacks, an operand stack, and an operator stack, to perform expression evaluation.

### Step by Step Explanation

 **1. Operand Stack and Operator Stack:**

- **Operand Stack:** This stack is used to store operands (numeric values) encountered in the expression.
- **Operator Stack:** This stack is used to store operators (+, -,* *, /) encountered in the expression.


 **2. Scanning the Expression:**

- The expression is scanned from left to right.
- When a numeric value (operand) is encountered, it is pushed onto the operand stack.
- When an operator is encountered, it is pushed onto the operator stack.

 **3. Handling Parentheses:**

- If an opening parenthesis is encountered, it is ignored.
- If a closing parenthesis is encountered, two operands and one operator are popped from the stacks, the operation is performed, and the result is pushed back onto the operand stack.

**4. Completing the Evaluation:**

- After scanning the entire expression, the algorithm continues to perform operations until both stacks are empty.

**Example:**
Let's consider the expression: `(3 + 4) * 5 - 6 / 2`

1. **Operand Stack:** `3 4 5 6`
2. **Operator Stack:** `+ * - /`

- After scanning the entire expression, the algorithm continues to perform operations:
    1. Pop `*`, pop `5`, and pop `4` (operand stack: `3 20`).
    2. Pop `-`, pop `2`, and pop `6` (operand stack: `3 20 3`).
    3. Pop `+`, pop `3`, and pop `3` (operand stack: `23`).

The final result is `23`, which is the evaluation of the given expression.
### Implementation

For Stack implementation a normal generic stack can be used from previous section [[3.Stacks]].

**Algorithm Implementation**
```java
package DijkstraTwoStackAlgorithm;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String equation="(5 + ((4 * 2) * (2 + 3)))";//45
        System.out.println(evaluate(equation));
        System.out.println(evaluate("(4/2)"));//2
        System.out.println(evaluate("(4-6)"));//-2
        System.out.println(evaluate("(5 + 3)"));//8
    }
    public static double evaluate(String exp){
        Stack<Double> numbers=new Stack<>();
        Stack<Character> operators=new Stack<>();
        for(char c:exp.toCharArray()){
            if(c=='*' || c=='+' || c=='-' || c=='/'){
                operators.push(c);
            } else if (c==')') {
                numbers.push(calculate(operators.pop(),numbers.pop(),numbers.pop()));
            } else if(Character.isDigit(c)){
                numbers.push((double)(c - '0'));
            }
        }
        return numbers.pop();
    }
    public static double calculate(char operator,double a,double b){
        switch (operator){
            case '+':
                return a+b;
            case '*':
                return a*b;
            case '-':
                return b-a;
            case '/':
                return b/a;
            default:
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid operator: " + operator);
        }
    }
}
```

**evaluate**
```java
public static double evaluate(String exp) {
    Stack<Double> numbers = new Stack<>();
    Stack<Character> operators = new Stack<>();

    for (char c : exp.toCharArray()) {
        if (c == '*' || c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '/') {
            operators.push(c);
        } else if (c == ')') {
            numbers.push(calculate(operators.pop(), numbers.pop(), numbers.pop()));
        } else if (Character.isDigit(c)) {
            numbers.push((double) (c - '0'));
        }
    }

    return numbers.pop();
}
```
- Takes an arithmetic expression as input and evaluates it using Dijkstra's Two-Stack Algorithm.
- Creates two empty stacks one for numbers other for operators.
- Iterates through each character in the expression.
- If the character is an operator (`*`, `+`, `-`, `/`), it is pushed onto the `operators` stack.
-  If the character is a digit, it is converted to a double and pushed onto the `numbers` stack.
- If the character is a closing parenthesis (`)`), it indicates the end of a subexpression. The algorithm pops an operator and two operands, performs the calculation, and pushes the result back onto the `numbers` stack. For calculation it calls another method `calculate`.

**calculate**
```java
public static double calculate(char operator, double a, double b) {
    switch (operator) {
        case '+':
            return a + b;
        case '*':
            return a * b;
        case '-':
            return b - a;
        case '/':
            return b / a;
        default:
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid operator: " + operator);
    }
}
```
- Takes 2 double values and a operator as character.
- Identifies the operator and performs a basic arithmetic calculation based on the given operator and two operands.
