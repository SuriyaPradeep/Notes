### What is Quick Select
Quick select is an algorithm for finding the k-th smallest (or largest) element in an unordered list. It is similar to the quicksort algorithm but differs in that it only partially sorts the list to determine the k-th element, rather than fully sorting the entire list. This makes quick select more efficient for this specific task compared to quicksort.

The basic idea behind quick select is to choose a pivot element from the list and partition the list into two parts: elements smaller than the pivot and elements larger than the pivot. By doing this partitioning, the pivot itself ends up in its final sorted position (like in quicksort). Then, depending on the position of the pivot relative to the desired k-th element, the algorithm recursively applies this process to either the left or right partition until the k-th element is found.

### Implementation
```java
import java.util.Random;

//It is an algorithm to find nth smallest element in an array without complete sorting
public class QuickSelect <T extends Comparable<T>>{
    public boolean less(T a,T b){
        return a.compareTo(b)<0;
    }
    public void swap(T[] arr,int i,int j){
        T temp=arr[i];
        arr[i]=arr[j];
        arr[j]=temp;
    }
    public void shuffle(T[] arr){
        Random random=new Random();
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            int r= random.nextInt(0,i+1);
            swap(arr,i,r);
        }
    }
    //Basic Partition from quick sort
    public int partition(T[] arr,int low,int high){
        int i=low;
        int j=high+1;
        T pivot=arr[low];
        while (true){
            while (less(arr[++i],pivot)){
                if(i==high){
                    break;
                }
            }
            while (less(pivot,arr[--j])){
                if(j==low){
                    break;
                }
            }
            if(i>=j){
                break;
            }
            swap(arr,i,j);
        }
        swap(arr,low,j);
        return j;
    }
    public T quickSelect(T[] arr,int k){
        shuffle(arr);
        int low=0;
        int high=arr.length-1;
        while (low<high){
            int j=partition(arr,low,high);
            if(j<k){
                low=j+1;
            } else if(j>k){
                high=j-1;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return arr[k];
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        QuickSelect<Integer> qs1=new QuickSelect<>();
        Integer[] arr={12,11,13,5,6,7};
        System.out.println(qs1.quickSelect(arr,1));//Should return 2nd smallest element ie 6
    }

}
```

Let's walk through the QuickSelect algorithm with an example to find the 2nd smallest element in the array `[12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]`.

1. **Initial Array:** `[12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]`
2. **Randomized Pivot Selection and Partitioning:**
    - First, we shuffle the array to ensure better average performance.
    - Let's say after shuffling, the array becomes `[7, 5, 12, 6, 11, 13]`.
    - We choose a random pivot, which is `7` in this case.
    - After partitioning around the pivot `7`, the array becomes `[5, 6, 7, 12, 11, 13]`.
    - The pivot `7` is now at its correct position in a sorted array.
3. **Recursive Steps:**
    - Since we are looking for the 2nd smallest element, and the pivot (`7`) is at index `2`, we know that the 2nd smallest element must be to the left of the pivot.
    - We recursively apply the QuickSelect algorithm to the left partition `[5, 6]`.
4. **Left Partition `[5, 6]`:**
    - We shuffle the left partition.
    - Let's say after shuffling, the array becomes `[6, 5]`.
    - We choose a random pivot, which is `6` in this case.
    - After partitioning around the pivot `6`, the array remains `[5, 6]`.
    - The pivot `6` is now at its correct position in a sorted array.
5. **Result:**
    - After the recursive call on the left partition, we find that the 2nd smallest element in the original array `[12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]` is `6`.
6. **Final Output:** `6`

This is how the Quick Select algorithm works to find the 2nd smallest element in the array `[12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]`. It efficiently finds the desired element without fully sorting the array.

### Time Complexity
Considering both partitioning time and recursive calls, if we express the time complexity of the Quick Select algorithm using the Master Theorem, we would find it to be O(n) on average.

However, it's important to note that the worst-case time complexity of Quick Select without randomization is O(n^2), which occurs when the chosen pivot is always the minimum or maximum element in the array. Therefore, randomization techniques like shuffling the array or selecting a random pivot significantly improve the average-case performance and ensure O(n) average-case time complexity.
