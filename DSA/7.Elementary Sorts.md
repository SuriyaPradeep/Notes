### What is Sorting
Sorting is the process of arranging a collection of elements in a specific order. The goal of sorting is to organize the elements in a way that makes it easier to search, retrieve, and analyze the data.

### Bubble Sort

Bubble sort works on the repeatedly swapping of adjacent elements until they are not in the intended order.
**Algorithm for Bubble Sort**
```
begin BubbleSort(arr)  
   for all array elements  
      if arr[i] > arr[i+1]  
         swap(arr[i], arr[i+1])  
      end if  
   end for     
   return arr     
end BubbleSort  
```

#### Working
Let the elements of array are -

![Bubble sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/bubble-sort-algorithm1.png)

##### First Pass

Sorting will start from the initial two elements. Let compare them to check which is greater.

![Bubble sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/bubble-sort-algorithm2.png)

Here, 32 is greater than 13 (32 > 13), so it is already sorted. Now, compare 32 with 26.

![Bubble sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/bubble-sort-algorithm3.png)

Here, 26 is smaller than 36. So, swapping is required. After swapping new array will look like -

![Bubble sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/bubble-sort-algorithm4.png)

Now, compare 32 and 35.

![Bubble sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/bubble-sort-algorithm5.png)

Here, 35 is greater than 32. So, there is no swapping required as they are already sorted.

Now, the comparison will be in between 35 and 10.

![Bubble sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/bubble-sort-algorithm6.png)

Here, 10 is smaller than 35 that are not sorted. So, swapping is required. Now, we reach at the end of the array. After first pass, the array will be -

![Bubble sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/bubble-sort-algorithm7.png)

Now, move to the second iteration.

##### Second Pass

The same process will be followed for second iteration.

![Bubble sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/bubble-sort-algorithm8.png)

Here, 10 is smaller than 32. So, swapping is required. After swapping, the array will be -

![Bubble sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/bubble-sort-algorithm9.png)

Now, move to the third iteration.

##### Third Pass

The same process will be followed for third iteration.

![Bubble sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/bubble-sort-algorithm10.png)

Here, 10 is smaller than 26. So, swapping is required. After swapping, the array will be -

![Bubble sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/bubble-sort-algorithm11.png)

Now, move to the fourth iteration.

##### Fourth pass

Similarly, after the fourth iteration, the array will be -

![Bubble sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/bubble-sort-algorithm12.png)

Hence, there is no swapping required, so the array is completely sorted.


#### Implementation
```java
package Sort;

import java.util.Arrays;

public class BubbleSort {
    private static <T extends Comparable<T>> void swap(T[] arr, int i, int j){
        T temp=arr[i];
        arr[i]=arr[j];
        arr[j]=temp;
    }
    private static <T extends Comparable<T>> boolean less(T a,T b){
        return a.compareTo(b)<0;
    }
    private static <T extends Comparable<T>> boolean isSorted(T[] arr){
        for(int i=1;i< arr.length;i++){
            if(less(arr[i],arr[i-1])){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    public static <T extends Comparable<T>> void sort(T[] arr){
        int n=arr.length;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            for(int j=i+1;j<n;j++){
                if(less(arr[j],arr[i])){
                    swap(arr,i,j);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Integer[] arr={10,5,1,4,3,2};
        sort(arr);
        System.out.println(isSorted(arr));
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
        String[] stringArr = {"banana", "apple", "orange", "grape", "kiwi"};
        sort(stringArr);
        System.out.println(isSorted(stringArr));
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(stringArr));
    }
}
```

The Above code is generic i.e. it can be used to sort any type of data using `Comparable` interface.The `Comparable` interface in Java is used to define the natural ordering of objects. Objects that implement the `Comparable` interface can be compared with each other, and the natural order of the objects is determined by the implementation of the `compareTo` method.
The`compareTo` method returns an integer value that indicates the relationship between the two objects being compared.  
Specifically:  
If the current object is less than the specified object, `compareTo` returns a negative integer.  
If the current object is equal to the specified object, `compareTo` returns 0.  
If the current object is greater than the specified object,` compareTo` returns a positive integer.
The `<T extends Comparable<T>>` syntax in the method signatures indicates that the generic type `T` must extend the `Comparable<T>` interface, ensuring type safety.


**swap**
```java
private static <T extends Comparable<T>> void swap(T[] arr, int i, int j) {
    T temp = arr[i];
    arr[i] = arr[j];
    arr[j] = temp;
}
```
This function is responsible for swapping two elements in an array. It takes an array `arr` and two indices `i` and `j`. The elements at indices `i` and `j` are exchanged.

**less**
```java
private static <T extends Comparable<T>> boolean less(T a, T b) {
    return a.compareTo(b) < 0;
}
```
This function compares two elements (a and b) using their compareTo method. It returns true if element a is less than element b, indicating that they are in the wrong order.

**isSorted**
```java
private static <T extends Comparable<T>> boolean isSorted(T[] arr) {
    for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (less(arr[i], arr[i - 1])) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```
The `isSorted` function checks if an array is sorted in ascending order. It iterates through the array and uses the `less` function to compare adjacent elements. If any adjacent elements are out of order, the function returns `false`. If the entire array is traversed without finding any out-of-order elements, it returns `true`.

**sort**
```java
public static <T extends Comparable<T>> void sort(T[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (less(arr[j], arr[i])) {
                swap(arr, i, j);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
The `sort` function implements the Bubble Sort algorithm. It takes an array `arr` of generic type `T` and sorts it in ascending order. The nested loops iterate through the array, and if an element at position `j` is less than the element at position `i`, it swaps them using the `swap` function.


#### Time Complexity

|Case|Time Complexity|
|---|---|
|**Best Case**|O(n2) |
|**Average Case**|O(n2)|
|**Worst Case**|O(n2)|
### Selection Sort
In selection sort, the smallest value among the unsorted elements of the array is selected in every pass and inserted to its appropriate position into the array. In selection sort, the first smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and placed at the first position. After that second smallest element is selected and placed in the second position. The process continues until the array is entirely sorted.

**Algorithm**
```j
SELECTION SORT(arr, n)  
  
Step 1: Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for i = 0 to n-1  
Step 2: CALL SMALLEST(arr, i, n, pos)  
Step 3: SWAP arr[i] with arr[pos]  
[END OF LOOP]  
Step 4: EXIT  
  
SMALLEST (arr, i, n, pos)  
Step 1: [INITIALIZE] SET SMALL = arr[i]  
Step 2: [INITIALIZE] SET pos = i  
Step 3: Repeat for j = i+1 to n  
if (SMALL > arr[j])  
     SET SMALL = arr[j]  
SET pos = j  
[END OF if]  
[END OF LOOP]  
Step 4: RETURN pos  
```

#### Working
Now, let's see the working of the Selection sort Algorithm.

To understand the working of the Selection sort algorithm, let's take an unsorted array. It will be easier to understand the Selection sort via an example.

Let the elements of array are -

![selection Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/selection-sort.png)

Now, for the first position in the sorted array, the entire array is to be scanned sequentially.

At present, **12** is stored at the first position, after searching the entire array, it is found that **8** is the smallest value.

![selection Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/selection-sort2.png)

So, swap 12 with 8. After the first iteration, 8 will appear at the first position in the sorted array.

![selection Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/selection-sort3.png)

For the second position, where 29 is stored presently, we again sequentially scan the rest of the items of unsorted array. After scanning, we find that 12 is the second lowest element in the array that should be appeared at second position.

![selection Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/selection-sort4.png)

Now, swap 29 with 12. After the second iteration, 12 will appear at the second position in the sorted array. So, after two iterations, the two smallest values are placed at the beginning in a sorted way.

![selection Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/selection-sort5.png)

The same process is applied to the rest of the array elements. Now, we are showing a pictorial representation of the entire sorting process.

![selection Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/selection-sort6.png)

Now, the array is completely sorted.
#### Implementation
```java
package Sort;

import java.util.Arrays;


public class SelectionSort  {
    private static <T extends Comparable<T>>boolean less(T v, T w) {
        return v.compareTo(w) < 0;
        /*The compareTo method is a method defined in the Comparable interface in Java.
        It is used to compare two objects for the purpose of sorting.
        The method returns an integer value that indicates the relationship between the two objects being compared.
        Specifically:
        If the current object is less than the specified object, compareTo returns a negative integer.
        If the current object is equal to the specified object, compareTo returns 0.
        If the current object is greater than the specified object, compareTo returns a positive integer.*/
    }
    private static <T extends Comparable<T>> void swap(T[] a, int i, int j)
    {
        T swap = a[i];
        a[i] = a[j];
        a[j] = swap;
    }
    private static <T extends Comparable<T>> boolean isSorted(T[] a)
    {
        for (int i = 1; i < a.length; i++)
            if (less(a[i], a[i-1])) return false;
        return true;
    }
    public static <T extends Comparable<T>> void sort(T[] a)
    {
        int N = a.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        {
            int min = i;
            for (int j = i+1; j < N; j++)
                if (less(a[j], a[min]))
                    min = j;
            swap(a, i, min);
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Integer[] arr={10,5,1,4,3,2};
        sort(arr);
        System.out.println(isSorted(arr));
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
        String[] stringArr = {"banana", "apple", "orange", "grape", "kiwi"};
        sort(stringArr);
        System.out.println(isSorted(stringArr));
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(stringArr));
    }
}
```

**sort**
```java
public static <T extends Comparable<T>> void sort(T[] a) {
    int N = a.length;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        int min = i;
        for (int j = i + 1; j < N; j++)
            if (less(a[j], a[min]))
                min = j;
        swap(a, i, min);
    }
}
```

The `sort` method is responsible for sorting an array `a` of generic type `T` using the Selection Sort algorithm.

1. **Outer Loop (`for i`):**
    - The outer loop (`for i`) iterates through the array from the beginning to the end.
    - It considers each element as a potential starting point of the sorted portion.
2. **Inner Loop (`for j`):**
    - The inner loop (`for j`) starts from the element after the current position of the outer loop (`i`).
    - It searches for the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the array.
3. **Finding the Minimum Element:**
    - The variable `min` keeps track of the index of the minimum element found so far.
    - If an element at position `j` is less than the element at position `min`, update `min` to `j`.
    - After completing the inner loop, the index `min` points to the minimum element in the unsorted portion.
4. **Swapping:**
    - Swap the element at the current position of the outer loop (`i`) with the minimum element found (`a[min]`).
    - This effectively moves the minimum element to its correct sorted position.
5. **Repeat:**
    - Repeat the process until the entire array is sorted.


#### Time Complexity

|Case|Time Complexity|

|**Best Case**|O(n2) |
|**Average Case**|O(n2)|
|**Worst Case**|O(n2)|
### Insertion Sort
Insertion sort works similar to the sorting of playing cards in hands. It is assumed that the first card is already sorted in the card game, and then we select an unsorted card. If the selected unsorted card is greater than the first card, it will be placed at the right side; otherwise, it will be placed at the left side. Similarly, all unsorted cards are taken and put in their exact place.

**Algorithm**
```
Step 1 - If the element is the first element, assume that it is already sorted. Return 1.

Step2 - Pick the next element, and store it separately in a key.

Step3 - Now, compare the key with all elements in the sorted array.

Step 4 - If the element in the sorted array is smaller than the current element, then move to the next element. Else, shift greater elements in the array towards the right.

Step 5 - Insert the value.

Step 6 - Repeat until the array is sorted.
```

#### Working
Now, let's see the working of the insertion sort Algorithm.

To understand the working of the insertion sort algorithm, let's take an unsorted array. It will be easier to understand the insertion sort via an example.

Let the elements of array are -

![Insertion Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/insertion-sort.png)

Initially, the first two elements are compared in insertion sort.

![Insertion Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/insertion-sort2.png)

Here, 31 is greater than 12. That means both elements are already in ascending order. So, for now, 12 is stored in a sorted sub-array.

![Insertion Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/insertion-sort3.png)

Now, move to the next two elements and compare them.

![Insertion Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/insertion-sort4.png)

Here, 25 is smaller than 31. So, 31 is not at correct position. Now, swap 31 with 25. Along with swapping, insertion sort will also check it with all elements in the sorted array.

For now, the sorted array has only one element, i.e. 12. So, 25 is greater than 12. Hence, the sorted array remains sorted after swapping.

![Insertion Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/insertion-sort5.png)

Now, two elements in the sorted array are 12 and 25. Move forward to the next elements that are 31 and 8.

![Insertion Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/insertion-sort6.png)

Both 31 and 8 are not sorted. So, swap them.

![Insertion Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/insertion-sort7.png)

After swapping, elements 25 and 8 are unsorted.

![Insertion Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/insertion-sort8.png)

So, swap them.

![Insertion Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/insertion-sort9.png)

Now, elements 12 and 8 are unsorted.

![Insertion Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/insertion-sort10.png)

So, swap them too.

![Insertion Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/insertion-sort11.png)

Now, the sorted array has three items that are 8, 12 and 25. Move to the next items that are 31 and 32.

![Insertion Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/insertion-sort12.png)

Hence, they are already sorted. Now, the sorted array includes 8, 12, 25 and 31.

![Insertion Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/insertion-sort13.png)

Move to the next elements that are 32 and 17.

![Insertion Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/insertion-sort14.png)

17 is smaller than 32. So, swap them.

![Insertion Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/insertion-sort15.png)

Swapping makes 31 and 17 unsorted. So, swap them too.

![Insertion Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/insertion-sort16.png)

Now, swapping makes 25 and 17 unsorted. So, perform swapping again.

![Insertion Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/insertion-sort17.png)

Now, the array is completely sorted.



#### Implementation
```java
package Sort;

import java.util.Arrays;

public class InsertionSort {
    private static <T extends Comparable<T>> void swap(T[] arr, int i, int j){
        T temp=arr[i];
        arr[i]=arr[j];
        arr[j]=temp;
    }
    private static <T extends Comparable<T>> boolean less(T a,T b){
        return a.compareTo(b)<0;
    }
    private static <T extends Comparable<T>> boolean isSorted(T[] arr){
        for(int i=1;i< arr.length;i++){
            if(less(arr[i],arr[i-1])){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    public static <T extends Comparable<T>> void sort(T[] arr){
        for(int i=0;i< arr.length;i++){
            for (int j=i;j>0;j--){
                if(less(arr[j],arr[j-1])){
                    swap(arr,j,j-1);
                } else{
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Integer[] arr={10,5,1,4,3,2};
        sort(arr);
        System.out.println(isSorted(arr));
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
        String[] stringArr = {"banana", "apple", "orange", "grape", "kiwi"};
        sort(stringArr);
        System.out.println(isSorted(stringArr));
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(stringArr));
    }
}
```

**sort**
```java
public static <T extends Comparable<T>> void sort(T[] arr) {
    for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        for (int j = i; j > 0; j--) {
            if (less(arr[j], arr[j - 1])) {
                swap(arr, j, j - 1);
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It is efficient for small datasets or partially sorted datasets.

1. **Outer Loop (`for i`):**
    - The outer loop (`for i`) starts from the second element (`i=1`) and iterates through the entire array.
    - It considers each element as the key to be inserted into the already sorted portion.
2. **Inner Loop (`for j`):**
    - The inner loop (`for j`) starts from the current position of the outer loop (`i`) and goes backward.
    - It compares the key element with the elements in the sorted portion, moving larger elements to the right.
3. **Insertion:**
    - The key element is repeatedly compared with the elements in the sorted portion until a smaller or equal element is found.
    - The key element is then inserted at the correct position in the sorted portion.
4. **Repeat:**
    - Steps 1-3 are repeated for each element in the array, effectively building the final sorted array.

### Shell Sort
It is a sorting algorithm that is an extended version of insertion sort. Shell sort has improved the average time complexity of insertion sort. As similar to insertion sort, it is a comparison-based and in-place sorting algorithm. Shell sort is efficient for medium-sized data sets.

In insertion sort, at a time, elements can be moved ahead by one position only. To move an element to a far-away position, many movements are required that increase the algorithm's execution time. But shell sort overcomes this drawback of insertion sort. It allows the movement and swapping of far-away elements as well.

This algorithm first sorts the elements that are far away from each other, then it subsequently reduces the gap between them. This gap is called as **interval.** This interval can be calculated by using the **Knuth's** formula given below -
```
hh = h * 3 + 1  
where, 'h' is the interval having initial value 1.
```
**Algorithm**
```
ShellSort(a, n) // 'a' is the given array, 'n' is the size of array  
for (interval = n/2; interval > 0; interval /= 2)  
for ( i = interval; i < n; i += 1)  
temp = a[i];  
for (j = i; j >= interval && a[j - interval] > temp; j -= interval)  
a[j] = a[j - interval];   
a[j] = temp;  
End ShellSort  
```
#### Working
Now, let's see the working of the shell sort Algorithm.

To understand the working of the shell sort algorithm, let's take an unsorted array. It will be easier to understand the shell sort via an example.

Let the elements of array are -

![Shell Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/shell-sort-algorithm1.png)

We will use the original sequence of shell sort, i.e., N/2, N/4,....,1 as the intervals.

In the first loop, n is equal to 8 (size of the array), so the elements are lying at the interval of 4 (n/2 = 4). Elements will be compared and swapped if they are not in order.

Here, in the first loop, the element at the 0th position will be compared with the element at 4th position. If the 0th element is greater, it will be swapped with the element at 4th position. Otherwise, it remains the same. This process will continue for the remaining elements.

At the interval of 4, the sublists are {33, 12}, {31, 17}, {40, 25}, {8, 42}.

![Shell Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/shell-sort-algorithm2.png)

Now, we have to compare the values in every sub-list. After comparing, we have to swap them if required in the original array. After comparing and swapping, the updated array will look as follows -

![Shell Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/shell-sort-algorithm3.png)

In the second loop, elements are lying at the interval of 2 (n/4 = 2), where n = 8.

Now, we are taking the interval of **2** to sort the rest of the array. With an interval of 2, two sublists will be generated - {12, 25, 33, 40}, and {17, 8, 31, 42}.

![Shell Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/shell-sort-algorithm4.png)

Now, we again have to compare the values in every sub-list. After comparing, we have to swap them if required in the original array. After comparing and swapping, the updated array will look as follows -

![Shell Sort Algorithm](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/shell-sort-algorithm5.png)

In the third loop, elements are lying at the interval of 1 (n/8 = 1), where n = 8. At last, we use the interval of value 1 to sort the rest of the array elements. In this step, shell sort uses insertion sort to sort the array elements.

Now, the array is sorted in ascending order.

#### Implementation
```java
package Sort;

import java.util.Arrays;

public class ShellSort {
    private static <T extends Comparable<T>> void swap(T[] arr, int i, int j){
        T temp=arr[i];
        arr[i]=arr[j];
        arr[j]=temp;
    }
    private static <T extends Comparable<T>> boolean less(T a,T b){
        return a.compareTo(b)<0;
    }
    private static <T extends Comparable<T>> boolean isSorted(T[] arr){
        for(int i=1;i< arr.length;i++){
            if(less(arr[i],arr[i-1])){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    public static  <T extends Comparable<T>> void sort(T[] arr){
        int n=arr.length;
        int h=1;
        while(h<n/3){
            h=3*h+1;
        }
        while(h>=1){
            for(int i=h;i<n;i++){
                for(int j=i;j>=h && less(arr[j],arr[j-h]);j-=h){
                    swap(arr,j,j-h);
                }
            }
            h=h/3;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Integer[] arr={10,5,1,4,3,2};
        sort(arr);
        System.out.println(isSorted(arr));
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
        String[] stringArr = {"banana", "apple", "orange", "grape", "kiwi"};
        sort(stringArr);
        System.out.println(isSorted(stringArr));
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(stringArr));
    }
}
```

**sort**
1. **Choose Initial Gap (`h`):**
    - The algorithm starts by choosing an initial value for the gap (`h`). Here, the choice is based on the 3x+1 increment sequence.
    - The while loop calculates the initial value of `h` until it exceeds one-third of the array size (`n`).
2. **Gap Sequence:**
    - The gap sequence is crucial for the efficiency of Shell Sort. The 3x+1 sequence (1, 4, 13, 40, ...) is a common choice.
3. **Main Sorting Loop:**
    - The outer loop iterates over decreasing values of `h`, reducing it from the initial value toward 1.
    - For each value of `h`, the algorithm performs an Insertion Sort pass on the array.
4. **Insertion Sort with Gap:**
    - The inner loop iterates over the array, starting from `h`.
    - It compares and swaps elements that are `h` positions apart, effectively sorting subarrays.
5. **Reducing Gap:**
    - After completing the Insertion Sort pass with the current gap value, the gap (`h`) is reduced for the next iteration.

### Shuffling
Shuffling is a process of rearranging the elements in a uniformly random permutation order. In the context of programming and algorithms, shuffling is often used to randomize the order of elements in a collection (such as an array or a list).

The purpose of shuffling is to eliminate any inherent order or bias in the original arrangement of elements.

#### Implementation
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Random;

public class Shuffling {
    private static <T extends Comparable<T>> void swap(T[] arr, int i, int j){
        T temp=arr[i];
        arr[i]=arr[j];
        arr[j]=temp;
    }
    private static <T extends Comparable<T>> boolean less(T a,T b){
        return a.compareTo(b)<0;
    }
    private static <T extends Comparable<T>> boolean isSorted(T[] arr){
        for(int i=1;i< arr.length;i++){
            if(less(arr[i],arr[i-1])){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    public static <T extends Comparable<T>>void shuffle(T[] arr){
        Random random = new Random();
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            int r= random.nextInt(0,i+1);
            swap(arr,i,r);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Integer[] arr={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10};
        shuffle(arr);
        System.out.println(isSorted(arr));
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
        String[] stringArr = {"apple","banana","grape","kiwi","orange"};
        shuffle(stringArr);
        System.out.println(isSorted(stringArr));
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(stringArr));
    }
}
```

**shuffle**
Implements the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm.
1. **Initialization:**
    - A `Random` object is created to generate random numbers.
2. **Iterating through the array:**
    - The loop variable `i` represents the current position in the array.
3. **Generating a random index:**
    - At each iteration, a random index `r` is generated using `random.nextInt(i + 1)`. This ensures that `r` is between 0 (inclusive) and `i + 1` (exclusive).
4. **Swapping elements:**
    - The element at position `i` is swapped with the element at the randomly chosen index `r`. This step ensures that each element has an equal probability of being placed at any position in the array.
5. **Completing the shuffle:**
    - After the loop completes, the entire array has been shuffled, and each element has been randomly rearranged.
