### What is Algorithm?

An algorithm is a process or a set of rules required to perform calculations or some other problem-solving operations especially by a computer. The formal definition of an algorithm is that it contains the finite set of instructions which are being carried in a specific order to perform the specific task. It is not the complete program or code; it is just a solution (logic) of a problem, which can be represented either as an informal description using a Flowchart or Pseudocode.

### What is Data Structure?

A **data structure** is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.
A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed.

### Classification of Data Structure

**Linear Data Structure**:Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure.   
Example: Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List, etc.
- Static Data Structure: Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. Example: array.
- Dynamic Data Structure: In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. Example: Queue, Stack, etc.

**Non-Linear Data Structure**:A non-linear data structure is a type of data structure where elements are not arranged in a sequential or linear order. In non-linear structures, elements can be interconnected in a more complex way, allowing for relationships between elements to form intricate patterns.
Example: Trees and Graphs.
