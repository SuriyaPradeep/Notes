### What is a Tree
**_A tree_** is also one of the data structures that represent hierarchical data. Suppose we want to show the employees and their positions in the hierarchical form then it can be represented as shown below:

![Tree](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/tree.png)

The above tree shows the **organization hierarchy** of some company. In the above structure, **_john_** is the **CEO** of the company, and John has two direct reports named as **_Steve_** and **_Rohan_**. Steve has three direct reports named **_Lee, Bob, Ella_** where **_Steve_** is a manager. Bob has two direct reports named **_Sal_** and **_Emma_**. **Emma** has two direct reports named **_Tom_** and **_Raj_**. Tom has one direct report named **_Bill_**. This particular logical structure is known as a **_Tree_**. Its structure is similar to the real tree, so it is named a **_Tree_**. In this structure, the **_root_** is at the top, and its branches are moving in a downward direction. Therefore, we can say that the Tree data structure is an efficient way of storing the data in a hierarchical way.

**Let's understand some key points of the Tree data structure.**

- A tree data structure is defined as a collection of objects or entities known as nodes that are linked together to represent or simulate hierarchy.
- A tree data structure is a non-linear data structure because it does not store in a sequential manner. It is a hierarchical structure as elements in a Tree are arranged in multiple levels.
- In the Tree data structure, the topmost node is known as a root node. Each node contains some data, and data can be of any type. In the above tree structure, the node contains the name of the employee, so the type of data would be a string.
- Each node contains some data and the link or reference of other nodes that can be called children.

**Some basic terms used in Tree data structure.**

Let's consider the tree structure, which is shown below:

![Tree](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/tree2.png)

In the above structure, each node is labeled with some number. Each arrow shown in the above figure is known as a **_link_** between the two nodes.

- **Root:** The root node is the topmost node in the tree hierarchy. In other words, the root node is the one that doesn't have any parent. In the above structure, node numbered 1 is **the root node of the tree.** If a node is directly linked to some other node, it would be called a parent-child relationship.
- **Child node:** If the node is a descendant of any node, then the node is known as a child node.
- **Parent:** If the node contains any sub-node, then that node is said to be the parent of that sub-node.
- **Sibling:** The nodes that have the same parent are known as siblings.
- **Leaf Node:-** The node of the tree, which doesn't have any child node, is called a leaf node. A leaf node is the bottom-most node of the tree. There can be any number of leaf nodes present in a general tree. Leaf nodes can also be called external nodes.
- **Internal nodes:** A node has atleast one child node known as an **_internal_**
- **Ancestor node:-** An ancestor of a node is any predecessor node on a path from the root to that node. The root node doesn't have any ancestors. In the tree shown in the above image, nodes 1, 2, and 5 are the ancestors of node 10.
- **Descendant:** The immediate successor of the given node is known as a descendant of a node. In the above figure, 10 is the descendant of node 5.

### Implementation of Tree

The tree data structure can be created by creating the nodes dynamically with the help of the pointers. The tree in the memory can be represented as shown below:

![Tree](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/tree4.png)

The above figure shows the representation of the tree data structure in the memory. In the above structure, the node contains three fields. The second field stores the data; the first field stores the address of the left child, and the third field stores the address of the right child.

```java
private class Node {  
	private T value;  
	private Node left, right;  
	private int size;  
	  
	public Node(T value) {  
	this.value = value;  
	this.left = this.right = null;  
	this.size = 1; // Initialize size to 1 for the new node  
	}  
}
```

### Binary Search Tree
#### What is Binary Tree
The Binary tree means that the node can have maximum two children. Here, binary name itself suggests that 'two'; therefore, each node can have either 0, 1 or 2 children.

**Let's understand the binary tree through an example.**

![Binary Tree](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/binary-tree.png)
#### What is Binary Search Tree
A binary search tree follows some order to arrange the elements. In a Binary search tree, the value of left node must be smaller than the parent node, and the value of right node must be greater than the parent node. This rule is applied recursively to the left and right subtrees of the root.

Let's understand the concept of Binary search tree with an example.

![Binary Search tree](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/binary-search-tree1.png)
#### Advantages of Binary search tree

- Searching an element in the Binary search tree is easy as we always have a hint that which subtree has the desired element.
- As compared to array and linked lists, insertion and deletion operations are faster in BST.

#### Implementation
```java
package BinarySearchTree;

public class BST<T extends Comparable<T>> {
    private class Node {
        private T value;
        private Node left, right;
        private int size;

        public Node(T value) {
            this.value = value;
            this.left = this.right = null;
            this.size = 1; // Initialize size to 1 for the new node
        }
    }

    private Node root;

        root = null;
    }

        node.size = 1 + size(node.left) + size(node.right);
        return node;
    }

        Node cur_node = root;
        while (cur_node != null) {
            int cmp = key.compareTo(cur_node.value);

                return true;
            } else if (cmp < 0) {

##### Function Explanation
Let's go through each method in the `BST` class and explain its purpose:

1. **`Node` Class:**
    - This is a private inner class representing a node in the binary search tree.
    - It contains fields for storing the node's value, left child, right child, and size (number of nodes in the subtree rooted at this node).
    - The constructor initializes these fields.
2. **Constructor:**
    - There are two constructors:
        - `public BST()`: Initializes an empty binary search tree with a `null` root.
        - `public BST(T value)`: Initializes a binary search tree with a single node containing the given value.
3. **`size()` Method:**
    - This method returns the size of the binary search tree, which is the total number of nodes in the tree.
    - It delegates to the private `size(Node node)` method.
4. **`size(Node node)` Method:**
    - This is a helper method that calculates the size of the subtree rooted at the specified node.
    - It recursively counts the number of nodes in the subtree.
5. **`insert(T value)` Method:**
    - This method inserts a new node with the given value into the binary search tree.
    - It delegates to the private `insert(Node node, T value)` method.
6. **`insert(Node node, T value)` Method:**
    - This is a helper method that recursively inserts a new node with the given value into the subtree rooted at the specified node.
    - It follows the binary search tree property to maintain the ordering of values.
7. **`search(T key)` Method:**
    - This method searches for a given key in the binary search tree.
    - It iteratively traverses the tree starting from the root and compares the key with the values of nodes.
    - If the key is found, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.
8. **`delete(T key)` Method:**
    - This method deletes a node with the given key from the binary search tree.
    - It delegates to the private `delete(Node node, T key)` method.
9. **`delete(Node node, T key)` Method:**
    - This is a helper method that recursively deletes a node with the given key from the subtree rooted at the specified node.
    - It handles three cases: node with no children, node with one child, and node with two children.
    - Case 1: Node with No Children (Leaf Node)
		- If the node to be deleted has no children, simply remove the node from the tree.
		- Set the parent's pointer to this node to `null`.
	- Case 2: Node with One Child
		- If the node to be deleted has only one child (either left or right), bypass the node and link its parent directly to its child.
		- If the node is the root, update the root pointer to point to its child.
		- If the node is not the root, update the parent's pointer to point to the child of the node to be deleted.
	- Case 3: Node with Two Children
		- If the node to be deleted has two children, finding a suitable replacement node is more complex.
		- One common approach is to find the successor (or predecessor) node of the node to be deleted.
		    - The successor is the smallest node in the right subtree of the node to be deleted.
		    - The predecessor is the largest node in the left subtree of the node to be deleted.
		- Replace the value of the node to be deleted with the value of the successor (or predecessor) node.
		- Recursively delete the successor (or predecessor) node, as it now has become the node to be deleted.
10. **`min(Node node)` Method:**
    - This method finds and returns the node with the minimum value in the subtree rooted at the specified node.
    - It iteratively traverses the left children of nodes until reaching a leaf node.
11. **`max(Node node)` Method:**
    - This method finds and returns the node with the maximum value in the subtree rooted at the specified node.
    - It iteratively traverses the right children of nodes until reaching a leaf node.
12. **Tree Traversal Methods (`printInorder`, `printPreorder`, `printPostorder`):**
    - These methods perform inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals of the binary search tree, respectively.
    - They delegate to private recursive helper methods `printInorder(Node node)`, `printPreorder(Node node)`, and `printPostorder(Node node)`.
13. **`printInorder()`, `printPreorder()`, `printPostorder()` Methods:**
    - These are public methods that start the respective tree traversal from the root node.
    - They provide a convenient way to print the elements of the tree in different orders.

##### Traversal

Inorder Traversal: 10 20 30 100 150 200 300  
Preorder Traversal: 100 20 10 30 200 150 300  
Postorder Traversal: 10 30 20 150 300 200 100

**Inorder**
Below is the idea to solve the problem:

> At first traverse **left subtree** then visit the **root** and then traverse the **right subtree**.

Follow the below steps to implement the idea:
- Traverse left subtree
- Visit the root and print the data.
- Traverse the right subtree
The [**inorder traversal**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inorder-tree-traversal-without-recursion/) of the BST gives the values of the nodes in sorted order. To get the decreasing order visit the right, root, and left subtree.

**Preorder**
Below is the idea to solve the problem:

> At first visit the **root** then traverse **left subtree** and then traverse the **right subtree**.

Follow the below steps to implement the idea:
- Visit the root and print the data.
- Traverse left subtree
- Traverse the right subtree

**Postorder**
Below is the idea to solve the problem:

> At first traverse **left subtree** then traverse the **right subtree** and then visit the **root**.

Follow the below steps to implement the idea:
- Traverse left subtree
- Traverse the right subtree
- Visit the root and print the data.
#### Basic Operation Explanation
##### Insertion
Now, let's see the creation of binary search tree using an example.

Suppose the data elements are **- 45, 15, 79, 90, 10, 55, 12, 20, 50**

- First, we have to insert **45** into the tree as the root of the tree.
- Then, read the next element; if it is smaller than the root node, insert it as the root of the left subtree, and move to the next element.
- Otherwise, if the element is larger than the root node, then insert it as the root of the right subtree.

Now, let's see the process of creating the Binary search tree using the given data element. The process of creating the BST is shown below -

**Step 1 - Insert 45.**

![Binary Search tree](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/binary-search-tree3.png)

**Step 2 - Insert 15.**

As 15 is smaller than 45, so insert it as the root node of the left subtree.

![Binary Search tree](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/binary-search-tree4.png)

**Step 3 - Insert 79.**

As 79 is greater than 45, so insert it as the root node of the right subtree.

![Binary Search tree](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/binary-search-tree5.png)

**Step 4 - Insert 90.**

90 is greater than 45 and 79, so it will be inserted as the right subtree of 79.

![Binary Search tree](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/binary-search-tree6.png)

**Step 5 - Insert 10.**

10 is smaller than 45 and 15, so it will be inserted as a left subtree of 15.

![Binary Search tree](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/binary-search-tree7.png)

**Step 6 - Insert 55.**

55 is larger than 45 and smaller than 79, so it will be inserted as the left subtree of 79.

![Binary Search tree](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/binary-search-tree8.png)

**Step 7 - Insert 12.**

12 is smaller than 45 and 15 but greater than 10, so it will be inserted as the right subtree of 10.

![Binary Search tree](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/binary-search-tree9.png)

**Step 8 - Insert 20.**

20 is smaller than 45 but greater than 15, so it will be inserted as the right subtree of 15.

![Binary Search tree](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/binary-search-tree10.png)

**Step 9 - Insert 50.**

50 is greater than 45 but smaller than 79 and 55. So, it will be inserted as a left subtree of 55.

![Binary Search tree](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/binary-search-tree11.png)

Now, the creation of binary search tree is completed. After that, let's move towards the operations that can be performed on Binary search tree.

We can perform insert, delete and search operations on the binary search tree.

Let's understand how a search is performed on a binary search tree.

##### Search
Searching means to find or locate a specific element or node in a data structure. In Binary search tree, searching a node is easy because elements in BST are stored in a specific order. The steps of searching a node in Binary Search tree are listed as follows -

1. First, compare the element to be searched with the root element of the tree.
2. If root is matched with the target element, then return the node's location.
3. If it is not matched, then check whether the item is less than the root element, if it is smaller than the root element, then move to the left subtree.
4. If it is larger than the root element, then move to the right subtree.
5. Repeat the above procedure recursively until the match is found.
6. If the element is not found or not present in the tree, then return NULL.

Now, let's understand the searching in binary tree using an example. We are taking the binary search tree formed above. Suppose we have to find node 20 from the below tree.

**Step1:**

![Binary Search tree](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/binary-search-tree12.png)

**Step2:**

![Binary Search tree](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/binary-search-tree13.png)

**Step3:**

![Binary Search tree](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/binary-search-tree14.png)

Now, let's see the algorithm to search an element in the Binary search tree.
##### Deletion
In a binary search tree, we must delete a node from the tree by keeping in mind that the property of BST is not violated. To delete a node from BST, there are three possible situations occur -

- The node to be deleted is the leaf node, or,
- The node to be deleted has only one child, and,
- The node to be deleted has two children

We will understand the situations listed above in detail.

**When the node to be deleted is the leaf node**

It is the simplest case to delete a node in BST. Here, we have to replace the leaf node with NULL and simply free the allocated space.

We can see the process to delete a leaf node from BST in the below image. In below image, suppose we have to delete node 90, as the node to be deleted is a leaf node, so it will be replaced with NULL, and the allocated space will free.

![Binary Search tree](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/binary-search-tree15.png)

**When the node to be deleted has only one child**

In this case, we have to replace the target node with its child, and then delete the child node. It means that after replacing the target node with its child node, the child node will now contain the value to be deleted. So, we simply have to replace the child node with NULL and free up the allocated space.

We can see the process of deleting a node with one child from BST in the below image. In the below image, suppose we have to delete the node 79, as the node to be deleted has only one child, so it will be replaced with its child 55.

So, the replaced node 79 will now be a leaf node that can be easily deleted.

![Binary Search tree](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/binary-search-tree16.png)

**When the node to be deleted has two children**

This case of deleting a node in BST is a bit complex among other two cases. In such a case, the steps to be followed are listed as follows -

- First, find the inorder successor of the node to be deleted.
- After that, replace that node with the inorder successor until the target node is placed at the leaf of tree.
- And at last, replace the node with NULL and free up the allocated space.

The inorder successor is required when the right child of the node is not empty. We can obtain the inorder successor by finding the minimum element in the right child of the node.

We can see the process of deleting a node with two children from BST in the below image. In the below image, suppose we have to delete node 45 that is the root node, as the node to be deleted has two children, so it will be replaced with its inorder successor. Now, node 45 will be at the leaf of the tree so that it can be deleted easily.

![Binary Search tree](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/binary-search-tree17.png)

Now let's understand how insertion is performed on a binary search tree.
#### Time Complexity
| Operations    | Best case time complexity | Average case time complexity | Worst case time complexity |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Insertion** | O(log n)                  | O(log n)                     | O(n)                       |
| **Deletion**  | O(log n)                  | O(log n)                     | O(n)                       |
| **Search**    | O(log n)                  | O(log n)                     | O(n)                       |
