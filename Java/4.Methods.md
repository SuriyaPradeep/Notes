### What is method?
The **method in Java** or Methods of Java is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and return the result to the caller. A Java method can perform some specific task without returning anything. Java Methods allow us to **reuse** the code without retyping the code. In Java, every method must be part of some class.

**Advantage of Method**

- Code Reusability
- Code Optimization

### Method Declaration

![[Pasted image 20231226093537.png]]

*Syntax*
```
<access_modifier> <return_type> <method_name>( list_of_parameters)
{
    //body
}
```

**Method Signature:** Every method has a method signature. It is a part of the method declaration. It includes the **method name** and **parameter list**.

**Access Specifier:** Access specifier or modifier is the access type of the method. It specifies the visibility of the method. Java provides **four** types of access specifier:

- **Public:** The method is accessible by all classes when we use public specifier in our application.
- **Private:** When we use a private access specifier, the method is accessible only in the classes in which it is defined.
- **Protected:** When we use protected access specifier, the method is accessible within the same package or subclasses in a different package.
- **Default:** When we do not use any access specifier in the method declaration, Java uses default access specifier by default. It is visible only from the same package only.

**Return Type:** Return type is a data type that the method returns. It may have a primitive data type, object, collection, void, etc. If the method does not return anything, we use void keyword.

**Method Name:** It is a unique name that is used to define the name of a method. It must be corresponding to the functionality of the method. Suppose, if we are creating a method for subtraction of two numbers, the method name must be **subtraction().** A method is invoked by its name. While naming the method first word should be lowercase and following word should start with uppercase. Few  examples are `areaOfCircle(), stringComparision(),sum() and area()`.

**Parameter List:** It is the list of parameters separated by a comma and enclosed in the pair of parentheses. It contains the data type and variable name. If the method has no parameter, left the parentheses blank.

**Method Body:** It is a part of the method declaration. It contains all the actions to be performed. It is enclosed within the pair of curly braces.

### Types of Method
There are two types of methods in Java:

- Predefined Method
	In Java, predefined methods are the method that is already defined in the Java class libraries is known as predefined methods. It is also known as the **standard library method** or **built-in method**.Few Examples are `sqrt(), pow()` etc.
- User-defined Method
	The method written by the user or programmer is known as **a user-defined** method. These methods are modified according to the requirement.



### Two Ways to Create Method

#### Static Method
#static #return 
A method that has static keyword is known as static method. In other words, a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of a class is known as a static method. We can also create a static method by using the keyword **static** before the method name.

The main advantage of a static method is that we can call it without creating an object. It can access static data members and also change the value of it. It is used to create an instance method. It is invoked by using the class name.

*Example*
```java
public class Static_method {  
	public static void main(String[] args) {  
		System.out.println(sum(8,6)); //Method Calling
		 
	}  
	public static int sum(int a,int b){  
		return a+b;  
	}  
}
```

#### Instance Method
The method of the class is known as an **instance method**. It is a **non-static** method defined in the class. Before calling or invoking the instance method, it is necessary to create an object of its class.

*Example*
```java
public class Instance_method {  
public static void main(String[] args) {  
//Object Creation for class Instance_method  
Instance_method im = new Instance_method();  
System.out.println(im.sum(8,5));  
//Calling method using object  
}  
public int sum(int a,int b){  
return a+b;  
}  
}
```


### Memory Allocation for Methods Calls

Methods calls are implemented through a stack. Whenever a method is called a stack frame is created within the stack area and after that, the arguments passed to and the local variables and value to be returned by this called method are stored in this stack frame and when execution of the called method is finished, the allocated stack frame would be deleted. There is a stack pointer register that tracks the top of the stack which is adjusted accordingly.

**Working of Stack**

The ide first executes the main block and calls the start function 
![[Pasted image 20231226100922.png]]

It adds start to the stack and executes statements in start method.
![[Pasted image 20231226100950.png]]

At line 10 it calls sum method and adds it to stack.
![[Pasted image 20231226101031.png]]

The method sum returns a value and removes itself from the stack

The start method continues again from where it left while calling.

### Parameters and Arguments
#parameter #arguments
**Parameters refers to the list of variables in a method declaration.** **Arguments are the actual values that are passed in when the method is invoked**
