#conditional
### Decision making in Java

Decision Making in programming is similar to decision-making in real life. In programming also face some situations where we want a certain block of code to be executed when some condition is fulfilled. 
A programming language uses control statements to control the flow of execution of a program based on certain conditions. These are used to cause the flow of execution to advance and branch based on changes to the state of a program.

### Conditional Operators
- `>` greater than
- `>=` greater than or equal to
- `<` less than
- `<=` less than or equal to
- `==` equal to
- `!=` not equal to

### Conditional  Statements

#### Simple IF
#if
if statement is the most simple decision-making statement. It is used to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will be executed or not i.e if a certain condition is true then a block of statements is executed otherwise not.

*Syntax:*
```
if(condition) 
{
   // Statements to execute if
   // condition is true
}
```

*Example:* Find whether the car was going above speed limit if yes print speeding ticket.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;  
public class If {  
	public static void main(String[] args) {  
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);  
		System.out.print("Enter the speed:");  
		int speed = scanner.nextInt();  
		if(speed>120){  
			System.out.println("Speeding Ticket!!");  
		}  
	}  
}
```

#### If Else
#if-else 
We can use the else statement with the if statement to execute a block of code when the condition is false.

*Syntax:*
```
if (condition)
{
    // Executes this block if
    // condition is true
}
else
{
    // Executes this block if
    // condition is false
}
```

*Example:* Check whether the given number is Even or Odd.
```java
import java.util.Scanner;  
public class If_else {  
	public static void main(String[] args) {  
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);  
		System.out.println("To check whether the given number is ODD or EVEN:");  
		System.out.println("Enter a integer");  
		int num = scan.nextInt();  
		if(num%2!=0){  
			System.out.println("The given number is ODD");  
		}else{  
			System.out.println("The given number is EVEN");  
		}  
	}  
}
```

#### Nested If
#if 
A nested if is an if statement that is the target of another if or else. Nested if statements mean an if statement inside an if statement.

*Syntax:*
```
if (condition1) 
{
   // Executes when condition1 is true
   if (condition2) 
   {
      // Executes when condition2 is true
   }
}
```

#### Else If:
#else-if
Here, a user can decide among multiple options. The if statements are executed from the top down. As soon as one of the conditions controlling the if is true, the statement associated with that ‘if’ is executed, and the rest of the ladder is bypassed. If none of the conditions is true, then the final else statement will be executed.

*Syntax:*
```
if (condition)
    statement;
else if (condition)
    statement;
.
.
else
    statement;
```

*Example:* Assign grade for respective marks
```java
import java.util.Scanner;  
public class Else_if {  
	public static void main(String[] args) {  
		//Conditional statement to check grade  
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);  
		System.out.println("Give points [0-100]:");  
		int marks = scan.nextInt();  
		if(marks<0){  
			System.out.println("Grade: impossible!");  
		} else if (marks<=49) {  
			System.out.println("Grade: failed");  
		}else if(marks<=59){  
			System.out.println("Grade: 1");  
		} else if (marks<=69) {  
			System.out.println("Grade: 2");  
		} else if (marks<=79) {  
			System.out.println("Grade: 3");  
		} else if (marks<=89) {  
			System.out.println("Grade: 4");  
		} else if (marks<=100) {  
			System.out.println("Grade: 5");  
		} else{  
			System.out.println("Grade: incredible!");  
		}  
	}  
}
```

*Example:* Leap Year
```java
import java.util.Scanner;  
public class LeapYear {  
	public static void main(String[] args) {  
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);  
		System.out.print("Give a year: ");  
		int year = scan.nextInt();  
		if(year%4==0 && year%100!=0){  
			System.out.println("The year is a leap year.");  
		}else if(year%4==0 && year%100==0 & year%400==0){  
			System.out.println("The year is a leap year.");  
		}else{  
			System.out.println("The year is not a leap year.");  
		}  
	}  
}
```
#### Switch-Case
#switch
The switch statement is a multiway branch statement. It provides an easy way to dispatch execution to different parts of code based on the value of the expression.

Working:
- The `switch` expression is evaluated once.
- The value of the expression is compared with the values of each `case`.
- Duplicate `case` values are not allowed.
- If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
- The `break` can save a lot of execution time because it "ignores" the  execution of all the rest of the code in the switch block.
- `default` is executed if none of the case where true

*Syntax:*
```
switch (expression)
{
  case value1:
    statement1;
    break;
  case value2:
    statement2;
    break;
  .
  .
  case valueN:
    statementN;
    break;
  default:
    statementDefault;
}
```

*Example:*
```java
public class Switch {  
	public static void main(String[] args) {  
		String str = "N";  
		int num=10;  
		switch (str){  
			//A break can save a lot of execution time because it "ignores" the  
			// execution of all the rest of the code in the switch block.  
			case "S":  
				System.out.println("The given word is N not S");  
				break;  
			case "B":  
				System.out.println("The given word is N not B");  
				break;  
			case "N":  
				System.out.println("The given word is N");  
				break;  
				//It executes default when all cases are false  
			default:  
				System.out.println("The letter is not present in the case");  
		}  
		switch (num){  
			case 1:  
				System.out.println("Wrong Number");  
				break;  
			default:  
				System.out.println("Default Case:number not present");   
		}  
	}  
}
```

#### Jump statements
#break #continue #return
 Java supports three jump statements: **break, continue** and **return**. These three statements transfer control to another part of the program.

##### Break
 In Java, a break is majorly used for: 
- Terminate a sequence in a switch statement.
- To exit a loop.
- Used as a “civilized” form of goto.

##### Continue
Sometimes it is useful to force an early iteration of a loop. That is, you might want to continue running the loop but stop processing the remainder of the code in its body for this particular iteration. This is, in effect, a goto just past the body of the loop, to the loop’s end. The continue statement performs such an action.

##### Return
The return statement is used to explicitly return a value and exit from a method. That is, it causes program control to transfer back to the caller of the method.
