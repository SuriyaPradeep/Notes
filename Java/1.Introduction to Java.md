### What is java?
Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, and run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

### Basic Java Terminology
**1.  Java Virtual Machine(JVM):**  This is generally referred to as [JVM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jvm-works-jvm-architecture/#:~:text=JVM(Java%20Virtual%20Machine)%20acts,(Write%20Once%20Run%20Anywhere).). There are three execution phases of a program. They are written, compile and run the program.

- Writing a program is done by a java programmer like you and me.
- The compilation is done by the **JAVAC** compiler which is a primary Java compiler included in the Java development kit (JDK). It takes the Java program as input and generates bytecode as output.
- In the Running phase of a program, **JVM** executes the bytecode generated by the compiler.

Now, we understood that the function of Java Virtual Machine is to execute the bytecode produced by the compiler. Every Operating System has a different JVM but the output they produce after the execution of bytecode is the same across all the operating systems. This is why Java is known as a **platform-independent language.**

**2. Bytecode in** the **Development Process:**  As discussed, the Javac compiler of JDK compiles the java source code into bytecode so that it can be executed by JVM. It is saved as **.class** file by the compiler. To view the bytecode, a disassembler like [javap](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javap-tool-in-java-with-examples/) can be used.

**3. Java Development Kit(JDK):** While we were using the term JDK when we learn about bytecode and JVM. So, as the name suggests, it is a complete Java development kit that includes everything including compiler, Java Runtime Environment (JRE), java debuggers, java docs, etc. For the program to execute in java, we need to install JDK on our computer in order to create, compile and run the java program.

**4. Java Runtime Environment (JRE):** JDK includes JRE. JRE installation on our computers allows the java program to run, however, we cannot compile it. JRE includes a browser, JVM, applet support, and plugins. For running the java program, a computer needs JRE.

**5. Garbage Collector:** In Java, programmers can’t delete the objects. To delete or recollect that memory JVM has a program called [Garbage Collector](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/garbage-collection-java/). Garbage Collectors can recollect the objects that are not referenced. So Java makes the life of a programmer easy by handling memory management. However, programmers should be careful about their code whether they are using objects that have been used for a long time. Because Garbage cannot recover the memory of objects being referenced.

**6. ClassPath:** The [classpath](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classpath-in-java/) is the file path where the java runtime and Java compiler look for **.class** files to load. By default, JDK provides many libraries. If you want to include external libraries they should be added to the classpath.


### Data Types
#data-type 
Java has two categories in which data types are segregated 

1. **Primitive Data Type: such as boolean, char, int, short, byte, long, float, and double
2. **Non-Primitive Data Type or Object Data type: such as String, Array, etc.

```java
public class Data_Types {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        // Creating and initializing custom character  
        char a = 'G';  
          
        //String  
        String str = "Hi!!!!";  
          
        // Integer data type is generally  
        // used for numeric values  
        int i = 89;  
          
        //Boolean Values contains true or false  
        boolean bool = true;  
          
        // use byte and short  
        // if memory is a constraint  
        //The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two’s complement integer.  
        byte b = 4;  
          
        // this will give error as number is  
        // larger than byte range  
        // byte b1 = 7888888955;  
          
        //The short data type is a 16-bit signed two’s complement integer.  
          
        short s = 56;  
          
        // this will give error as number is  
        // larger than short range  
        // short s1 = 87878787878;  
          
        // by default fraction value  
        // is double in java  
        double d = 4.355453532;  
          
        // for float use 'f' as suffix as standard  
        float f = 4.7333434f;  
          
        // need to hold big range of numbers then we need  
        // this data type  
        long l = 12121;  
          
        System.out.println("char: " + a);  
        System.out.println("String: "+ str);  
        System.out.println("Boolean: "+bool);  
        System.out.println("integer: " + i);  
        System.out.println("byte: " + b);  
        System.out.println("short: " + s);  
        System.out.println("float: " + f);  
        System.out.println("double: " + d);  
        System.out.println("long: " + l);  
    }  
}
```


### Output
#output
In java we use `System.out.print()` to print our output

```java
public class Hello_world {  
	public static void main(String[] args){  
		// Command Line in Java  
		/*Multi-Line  
		Command Line  
		*/  
		System.out.println("Hello World!!");   
	}  
}
```

**Basics on how java  acts for use of + operator in print **

In java when we write
```java
System.out.println(1 + 2 + "3");
```

Output: 33

```java
System.out.println("1" + 2 + 3);
```

Output: 123
Well, it's a thing called order of operations.

1 + 2 is calculated to equal 3 and then the string "3" is appended to it converting the first 3 to a string and printing "33".

In your second instance, "1" is already a string so adding numbers will convert them to strings to match, so appending "2" and then appending "3" and printing "123".

P.S. Strings take precedence because they have a higher casting priority than integers do, therefore it will convert integers to strings but not strings to integers, as with the second example.

### Input
#input
In Java, Scanner is a class in java.util package used for obtaining the input of the primitive types like int, double, etc. and strings.

Scanner class helps to take the standard input stream in Java. So, we need some methods to extract data from the stream. Methods used for extracting data are mentioned below:

| Method | Description |
|----------|--------------|
|nextBoolean()|Used for reading Boolean value|
|nextByte()|Used for reading Byte value|
|nextInt()|Used for reading Int value|
|nextFloat()|Used for reading float value|
|nextLine()|Used for reading String|

```java
import java.util.Scanner;  
public class Input {  
	public static void main(String[] args) {  
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);  
		System.out.println("What's your name?");  
		//String Input  
		String name = scanner.nextLine();  
		//Character Input  
		//Take Only First Character from the given input  
		System.out.println("What's your gender?");  
		char gender = scanner.next().charAt(0);  
		//Integer & Float Input  
		System.out.println("Enter Your Age:");  
		int age= scanner.nextInt();  
		System.out.println("Enter Your marks:");  
		float marks = scanner.nextFloat();  
		//String Concatenation  
		System.out.println("Hi "+ name + " of age " + age + ". You have scored " + marks + " marks");  
		System.out.println("Gender: "+gender);  
	}  
}
```

Taking input as string and converting.
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
public class DifferentTypesOfInput {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Give a string:");
        String str = scan.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Give an integer:");
        //valueOf can be used for type conversion
        int num1 = Integer.valueOf(scan.next());
        System.out.println("Give a double:");
        double num2 = Double.valueOf(scan.next());
        System.out.println("Give a boolean:");
        boolean bool = Boolean.valueOf(scan.next());
        System.out.println("You gave the string "+str+"\nYou gave the integer "+num1+"\nYou gave the double "+num2+"\nYou gave the boolean "+bool);
    }
}
```

*Example:*
Find square root of a given positive number
#Math 
```java
import java.util.Scanner;  
public class Sqrt {  
	public static void main(String[] args) {  
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);  
		System.out.print("Enter an positive integer to find SQRT:");  
		int num = scanner.nextInt();  
		System.out.println("SQRT="+Math.sqrt(num));  
		//Sqrt calculates square root int default it returns in double  
	}  
}
```
### Variable's
#variable
A variable can be thought of as a container in which information of a given type can be stored. Examples of these different types include text (`String`), whole numbers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`double`), and whether something is true or false (`boolean`). A value is assigned to a variable using the equals sign (`=`).Variable names are unique - no two variables can have the same name. The variable saves location where the assigned value is stored.

`int data=20;

```java
String text = "contains text";
int wholeNumber = 123;
double floatingPoint = 3.141592653;
boolean trueOrFalse = true;

System.out.println("Text variable: " + text);
System.out.println("Integer variable: " + wholeNumber);
System.out.println("Floating-point variable: " + floatingPoint);
System.out.println("Boolean: " + trueOrFalse);
```

The variable type is stated when the variable is first declared. When a new value is assigned to the variable again, the type is no longer declared. 
```java
int num = 12345;
num=5678;
```

We can change the value but not the type i.e
```java
int num =123;
num="Suriya"
```
It will throw an error.

####  Types of Variables in Java
![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230405113005/Types-of-Variables-in-Java.webp)

**Local Variable:**
A variable defined within a block or method or constructor is called a local variable.

```java
// Java Program to implement
// Local Variables
import java.io.*;

class GFG {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		// Declared a Local Variable
		int var = 10;

		// This variable is local to this main method only
		System.out.println("Local Variable: " + var);
	}
}

```

**Instance Variable:**
Instance variables are non-static variables and are declared in a class outside of any method, constructor, or block. As instance variables are declared in a class, these variables are created when an object of the class is created and destroyed when the object is destroyed.- Instance variables can be accessed only by creating objects.
```java
// Java Program to demonstrate
// Instance Variables
import java.io.*;

class GFG {

	// Declared Instance Variable
	public String geek;
	public int i;
	public Integer I;
	public GFG()
	{
		// Default Constructor
		// initializing Instance Variable
		this.geek = "Shubham Jain";
	}

	// Main Method
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		// Object Creation
		GFG name = new GFG();

		// Displaying O/P
		System.out.println("Geek name is: " + name.geek);
		System.out.println("Default value for int is "
						+ name.i);
	
		// toString() called internally
		System.out.println("Default value for Integer is "
						+ name.I);
	}
}
```

**Static Variable:**
#static 
Static variables are also known as class variables. These variables are declared similarly to instance variables. The difference is that static variables are declared using the static keyword within a class outside of any method, constructor, or block. Unlike instance variables, we can only have one copy of a static variable per class, irrespective of how many objects we create. Unlike instance variable we need to access the static variable using class instead of object name.
```java
// Java Program to demonstrate
// Static variables
import java.io.*;

class GFG {
	// Declared static variable
	public static String geek = "Shubham Jain";

	public static void main(String[] args)
	{

		// geek variable can be accessed without object
		// creation Displaying O/P GFG.geek --> using the
		// static variable
		System.out.println("Geek Name is : " + GFG.geek);

		// static int c=0;
		// above line,when uncommented,
		// will throw an error as static variables cannot be
		// declared locally.
	}
}
```

**Difference between Static Variable and Instance Variable**
- Each object will have its own copy of an instance variable, whereas we can only have one copy of a static variable per class, irrespective of how many objects we create. Thus, ****static variables**** are good for ****memory**** ****management****.
- Changes made in an instance variable using one object will not be reflected in other objects as each object has its own copy of the instance variable. In the case of a static variable, changes will be reflected in other objects as static variables are common to all objects of a class.
- We can access instance variables through object references, and static variables can be accessed directly using the class name****.****
- Instance variables are created when an object is created with the use of the keyword ‘new’ and destroyed when the object is destroyed. Static variables are created when the program starts and destroyed when the program stops.
### Basic Arithmetic Operators
#arthmetic
These operators involve the mathematical operators that can be used to perform various simple or advanced arithmetic operations on the primitive data types referred to as the operands. Let’s look at the various operators that Java has to provide under the arithmetic operators.
![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211203114825/arithmeticoperators.png)

```java
import java.util.Scanner;  
public class Arithmetic_Operators {  
	public static void main(String[] args) {  
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);  
		System.out.print("Enter a number:");  
		int num1 = scanner.nextInt();  
		System.out.print("Enter a number:");  
		int num2 = scanner.nextInt();  
		System.out.println(num1+"+"+num2+"="+(num1+num2));  
		System.out.println(num1+"-"+num2+"="+(num1-num2));  
		System.out.println(num1+"*"+num2+"="+(num1*num2));  
		//If we take input as integer we need to add float to not round-off the value  
		System.out.println(num1+"/"+num2+"="+((float)num1/(float)num2));  
		System.out.println(num1+"%"+num2+"="+(num1%num2));  
		System.out.println("The Average of 2 numbers is "+(float)(num1+num2)/2);   
	}  
}
```
