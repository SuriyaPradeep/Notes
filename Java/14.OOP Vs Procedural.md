### OOP
[Object-oriented programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basic-concepts-of-object-oriented-programming-using-c/) can be defined as a programming model which is based upon the concept of objects. Objects contain data in the form of attributes and code in the form of methods. In object-oriented programming, computer programs are designed using the concept of objects that interact with the real world. Object-oriented programming languages are various but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types. 

**Languages used in Object-Oriented Programming:** 

> Java, C++, C#, Python, 
> PHP, JavaScript, Ruby, Perl, 
> Objective-C, Dart, Swift, Scala.


### Procedural
[Procedural Programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-programming-paradigms/) can be defined as a programming model which is derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of calling procedure. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines or functions, simply consist of a series of computational steps to be carried out. During a program’s execution, any given procedure might be called at any point, including by other procedures or itself. 

**Languages used in Procedural Programming:** 

> FORTRAN, ALGOL, COBOL, 
> BASIC, Pascal and C.


### Differences
|Procedural Oriented Programming|Object-Oriented Programming|
|---|---|
|In procedural programming, the program is divided into small parts called _**functions**_.|In object-oriented programming, the program is divided into small parts called _**objects**_.|
|Procedural programming follows a _**top-down approach**_.|Object-oriented programming follows a _**bottom-up approach**_.|
|There is no access specifier in procedural programming.|Object-oriented programming has access specifiers like private, public, protected, etc.|
|Adding new data and functions is not easy.|Adding new data and function is easy.|
|Procedural programming does not have any proper way of hiding data so it is _**less secure**_.|Object-oriented programming provides data hiding so it is _**more secure**_.|
|In procedural programming, overloading is not possible.|Overloading is possible in object-oriented programming.|
|In procedural programming, there is no concept of data hiding and inheritance.|In object-oriented programming, the concept of data hiding and inheritance is used.|
|In procedural programming, the function is more important than the data.|In object-oriented programming, data is more important than function.|
|Procedural programming is based on the _**unreal world**_.|Object-oriented programming is based on the _**real world**_.|
|Procedural programming is used for designing medium-sized programs.|Object-oriented programming is used for designing large and complex programs.|
|Procedural programming uses the concept of procedure abstraction.|Object-oriented programming uses the concept of data abstraction.|
|Code reusability absent in procedural programming,|Code reusability present in object-oriented programming.|
|**Examples:** C, FORTRAN, Pascal, Basic, etc.|**Examples:** C++, Java, Python, C#, etc.|
