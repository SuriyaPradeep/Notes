### Data Type
![](https://static.javatpoint.com/images/java-data-types.png)

Java provides two types of [data types](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-data-types) **primitive** and **reference** data type. The primitive data types are predefined in Java that serves as a fundamental building block while the **reference** data type refers to where data is stored.

### Primitive Type

**Primitive Type** also known as **Value Type** variables such as `int double float boolean char short byte long` hold their actual values.

### Reference Type

In Java, **Non-Primitive** data types are known as **Reference Type**. Reference Type contain a reference to the location that contains the value(s) relating to that variable.
i.e. that the value of the variable is a reference that points to the location that contains the information.

All of the variables provided by Java (other than the eight primitive variables mentioned above) are reference type. A programmer is also free to create their own variable types by defining new classes.
```java
Name leevi = new Name("Leevi");
```

The call has the following parts:

- Whenever a new variable is declared, its type must be stated first. We declare a variable of type `Name` below. For the program to execute successfully, there must be a `Name` class available for the program to use.

```java
Name ...
```

- We state the name of the variable as its declared. You can reference the value of the variable later on by its name. Below, the variable name is defined as leevi.

```java
Name leevi...
```

- Values can be assigned to variables. Objects are created from classes by calling the class constructor. This constructor defines the values assigned to the instance variables of the object being created. We're assuming in the example below that the class `Name` has a constructor that takes a string as parameter.

```java
... new Name("Leevi");
```

- The constructor call returns a value that is a reference to the newly-created object. The equality sign tells the program that the value of the right-hand side expression is to be copied as the value of the variable on the left-hand side. The reference to the newly-created object, returned by the constructor call, is copied as the value of the variable `leevi`.

```java
Name leevi = new Name("Leevi");
```

*Count.java*
```java
package Reference_Variable;

public class Count {
    private int count;
    public Count(int num) {
        this.count = num;
    }
    public void increase(){
        this.count++;
    }
    public void decrease(){
        this.count--;
    }
    public String toString(){
        return String.valueOf(this.count);
    }
}
```

*Main.java*
```java
package Reference_Variable;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Count a=new Count(1);
        System.out.println("A(No change):"+a);
        //Copy value a to b
        Count b=a;
        System.out.println("B(No change):"+b);
        b.increase();
        System.out.println("B(Increase 1):"+b);
        System.out.println("A(No change):"+a);
        //Here a is also increased by 1
        a.decrease();
        System.out.println("A(Decrease 1):"+a);
        System.out.println("B(No change):"+b);
        //Here b is also decreased by 1
        System.out.println("A(Before calling method):"+a);
        increase(a);
        System.out.println("A(After calling method):"+a);

    }
    public static void increase(Count c){
        //Here it changes the actual value
        c.increase();
    }
}

```

Output:
```
A(No change):1
B(No change):1
B(Increase 1):2
A(No change):2
A(Decrease 1):1
B(No change):1
A(Before calling method):1
A(After calling method):2
```
