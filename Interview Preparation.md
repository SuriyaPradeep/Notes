### React

#### What is react

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, where you can create reusable UI components. It was developed by Facebook and is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

#### What is JSX

JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. It is used with React to describe what the UI should look like. Babel, a JavaScript compiler, is used to convert JSX into regular JavaScript.

#### What are props in react

Props (short for properties) are a mechanism for passing data from parent to child components. They are read-only and immutable, ensuring that a component cannot directly modify the data it receives from its parent.

#### What is the difference between state and props in react

Props are used to pass data from parent to child components, while the state is a local data storage that is specific to a component and can change over time. State is managed within the component, whereas props are passed into the component.

#### What is virtual DOM

The virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM elements generated by React components. When the state of an object changes, the virtual DOM updates only the object that has changed, and then it efficiently updates the real DOM to match the virtual DOM.

#### What is higher order Component

A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props or behavior. It is a pattern used for reusing component logic.

#### What are hooks

Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Common hooks include `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, and `useReducer`.

#### How does useEffect hook works

The `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects in functional components. It takes a function as its first argument, and this function can contain code for operations like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.

#### Dependency Array

This array lists the variables that the effect depends on. The effect re-runs whenever any of these dependencies change. If you pass an empty array, the effect runs only once, after the initial render.

#### useState

The `useState` hook allows you to add state to functional components. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update it.
When `useState` is called, it initializes state with the provided initial value. The initial value can be of any type (number, string, object, array, etc.).
The `useState` hook returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update it. When `setState` is called, it updates the state and triggers a re-render of the component with the new state.


#### Components

React components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable pieces of UI that can be combined to create complex user interfaces. Components can be either class components or functional components.

### Node.js Interview Questions

#### What is Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. It is designed to build scalable network applications.
#### What is npm?

npm stands for Node Package Manager. It is the default package manager for Node.js and is used to manage dependencies for JavaScript projects.

#### What is event loop in Node.js

The event loop is a mechanism that handles and processes external events and converts them into callback invocations. It allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations despite the fact that JavaScript is single-threaded.

#### What are streams in Node.js

Streams are objects that let you read data from a source or write data to a destination in a continuous fashion. There are four types of streams in Node.js: Readable, Writable, Duplex, and Transform streams.

#### What is middleware in express JS

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. They can execute code, make changes to the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, and call the next middleware function.

#### How do you handle asynchronous operations in Node.js

Asynchronous operations in Node.js can be handled using callbacks, promises, and async/await. These methods allow you to manage operations that do not complete immediately, such as network requests or file system operations.

#### Asynchronous and Synchronous

The term "asynchronous" (often abbreviated as "async") refers to a programming paradigm in which operations can run independently of the main program flow and can complete at some point in the future, allowing the program to continue executing other tasks in the meantime. This is in contrast to "synchronous" operations, where tasks are executed one after the other, with each task waiting for the previous one to complete before starting.

#### Async/Await

- **`async`**: Used to declare an asynchronous function. When called, it returns a coroutine object. Inside an `async` function, you can use `await` to pause the function's execution until the awaited coroutine completes.
- **`await`**: Used to pause the execution of an `async` function until the result of an awaited coroutine or Future is available.

### OOPS

#### 4 pillars of OOPS

- **Encapsulation**: Binding data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
- **Abstraction**: Hiding the complex implementation details and providing only essential features to the user.
- **Inheritance**: Allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (base class or superclass).
- **Polymorphism**: The ability of objects to take on different forms or types. It allows methods to be written that can work with objects of multiple classes.

#### Difference between abstraction and encapulation

- **Encapsulation**:
    - It is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
    - It hides the internal state of an object from the outside world and only exposes a public interface to interact with the object.
- **Abstraction**:
    - It focuses on the essential features of an object, hiding complex implementation details.
    - It allows defining a class with a simple interface for a complex system, providing only relevant information to the user.



#### How does polymorphism work in object-oriented programming?

**Polymorphism**:
    - It allows methods to be written that can work with objects of multiple classes.
    - It can be achieved through method overriding (in the case of inheritance) and method overloading (where multiple methods have the same name but different parameters).

#### Method overriding and method overloading

**Method Overriding**:
- It occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
- The subclass method overrides the superclass method with its own implementation.

**Method Overloading**:
- Method overloading allows you to define multiple methods with the same name but with different parameters or different parameter types. When you invoke an overloaded method, the compiler determines which version of the method to call based on the arguments you pass during the method call.

#### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). It refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions that operate on the data) into a single unit called a class. In encapsulation, the internal state of an object is hidden from the outside world, and access to it is restricted to methods of the class.
#### Abstraction

Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that focuses on hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the essential features or functionalities to the user. It involves creating a simplified model of a complex system, emphasizing what an object does instead of how it does it.
#### Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) where a class (subclass or derived class) inherits attributes and behaviors (methods) from another class (base class or superclass). It allows one class to reuse the code defined in another class, establishing a hierarchical relationship between classes.
#### Polymorphism

Polymorphism is a key concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables methods to be defined in a superclass and overridden by its subclasses, providing flexibility and extensibility in software design.

#### Class and objects

**Class**:
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and behaviors (methods) that objects of the class will have. In simpler terms, a class is like a blueprint for a house, providing specifications for how objects should be created and what they can do.

**Object**:
An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity that is modeled using the attributes and behaviors defined in the class. Using our previous analogy, if a class is a blueprint for a house, an object is an actual house built from that blueprint.

### OS
#### What is OS?
An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware.

#### What is function of OS
- **Process Management**: Manages processes in the system, including process scheduling and coordination.
- **Memory Management**: Handles allocation and deallocation of memory space as needed by various programs.
- **File System Management**: Manages files on different storage devices, including their creation, deletion, and access.
- **Device Management**: Manages device communication via their respective drivers.
- **Security and Access Control**: Protects data and resources from unauthorized access and ensures secure multi-user access.

#### What is process & Thread
- **Process**: A process is an instance of a program in execution. It has its own memory space, system resources, and execution context.
- **Thread**: A thread is the smallest unit of a process that can be scheduled for execution. Threads within the same process share the same memory space and resources.

#### Different between multitasking, multithreading and multiprocessing
- **Multitasking**: The ability of the OS to execute more than one task simultaneously on a single CPU.
- **Multithreading**: The ability of a CPU (or a single core in a multi-core processor) to execute multiple threads concurrently.
- **Multiprocessing**: The use of two or more CPUs within a single computer system to execute processes simultaneously.


#### What is deadlock
A deadlock is a situation in an operating system where two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource.

#### Conditions for deadlock to happen
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: At least one resource must be held in a non-sharable mode.
2. **Hold and Wait**: A process holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources held by other processes.
3. **No Preemption**: Resources cannot be preempted; they must be released voluntarily by the process holding them.
4. **Circular Wait**: A set of processes are waiting for each other in a circular chain.

#### What is kernel
The kernel is the core part of an operating system. It manages system resources (CPU, memory, devices) and allows other programs to run and use these resources.

#### Virtual memory
Virtual memory is a memory management capability of an operating system that uses hardware and software to allow a computer to compensate for physical memory shortages by temporarily transferring data from random access memory (RAM) to disk storage.

#### What is context switch
A context switch is the process of storing the state of a process or thread, so that it can be resumed later, and restoring the state of another process or thread. This allows multiple processes or threads to share a single CPU.

#### Monolithic kernel and micro kernel
- **Monolithic Kernel**: All OS services (e.g., process management, file system, device drivers) run in the kernel space. It is faster but less secure.
- **Microkernel**: Only the most essential services (e.g., inter-process communication, basic scheduling) run in the kernel space, while other services run in user space. It is more secure and stable but can be slower due to increased context switches.

#### What are system calls
System calls provide the interface between a process and the operating system. They allow user-level processes to request services from the kernel, such as file operations, process control, and communication.

#### What is paging
Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory. It allows physical memory to be divided into fixed-size blocks called pages, which can be mapped to any free page frame in physical memory.

#### What is segmentation
Segmentation is a memory management technique where the memory is divided into different segments of variable size, each representing a logical unit such as a function, object, or data array.

#### What is file system
A file system is a method and data structure that the operating system uses to control how data is stored and retrieved on a disk. It manages the organization, storage, retrieval, naming, sharing, and protection of files.

#### Swapping and paging
- **Swapping**: Entire processes are swapped in and out of the main memory, typically to/from disk.
- **Paging**: Only fixed-size pages of a process are moved in and out of memory, which allows for more efficient use of memory

#### Process scheduling algorithms
**First Come First Serve**
- This is the simplest scheduling algorithm.
- Processes are attended to in the order they arrive in the ready queue.

**Shortest Job First**
- The process with the shortest execution time is selected next.
- Can be preemptive or non-preemptive.

**Priority Scheduling**
- Each process is assigned a priority.
- The process with the highest priority (smallest integer value) is selected next.

**Round Robin**
- Each process is assigned a fixed time slice (quantum).
- Processes are cycled through in a round-robin manner.

**Multilevel Scheduling**
- Processes are divided into different queues based on certain criteria (priority, process type).
- Each queue can have its own scheduling algorithm.

**Multilevel Feedback Scheduling**
- Similar to multilevel queue scheduling but allows processes to move between queues based on their behavior and aging.

#### Page replacement
**Least Recently Used**
- A page replacement algorithm used in virtual memory management.
- Replaces the page that has not been used for the longest period of time.

**First In First Out**
A page replacement algorithm that replaces the oldest page in memory.

**Optimal Page Replacement**
- Replaces the page that will not be used for the longest period in the future.
- Theoretical and not implementable in practice without future knowledge.

### Preemptive
In preemptive scheduling, the operating system can interrupt and suspend the currently running process in favor of another process. This ensures that high-priority tasks can be executed promptly.

#### Non Preemptive
In non-preemptive scheduling, once a process starts execution, it runs until it finishes or voluntarily yields control of the CPU. The operating system cannot forcibly take control away from the running process.

#### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol used in computer networks to ensure reliable and ordered delivery of data between devices. It establishes a connection before data transfer, verifies the receipt of data, and retransmits any lost packets. TCP is widely used for applications where data integrity and reliability are crucial, such as web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), email (SMTP), and file transfer (FTP).

#### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

UDP is a connectionless protocol used for fast, efficient transmission of data without the overhead of establishing a connection. It does not guarantee delivery, order, or error checking, making it suitable for applications where speed is more critical than reliability. Examples include real-time applications like video streaming, online gaming, and Voice over IP (VoIP), where occasional data loss is acceptable.


#### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

 Description:

- HTTP is a protocol used for transmitting hypertext (web pages) over the Internet.
- It operates on the application layer of the OSI model and is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.

Key Characteristics:

- **Port**: Uses port 80 by default.
- **Security**: Data is transmitted in plain text, making it vulnerable to interception and attacks like eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle (MITM).
- **Usage**: Commonly used for accessing websites that do not require secure communication, such as public information pages.

#### HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)

#### Description:

- HTTPS is an extension of HTTP that adds a layer of security using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security).
- It ensures that the data exchanged between the client and server is encrypted and secure from eavesdroppers.

#### Key Characteristics:

- **Port**: Uses port 443 by default.
- **Security**: Data is encrypted, providing confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. This prevents interception, tampering, and MITM attacks.
- **Usage**: Used for secure communication, especially on websites that handle sensitive data, such as online banking, e-commerce, and login pages.

Key Differences

    - **HTTP**: No encryption; data is sent in plain text.
    - **HTTPS**: Data is encrypted using SSL/TLS, ensuring secure communication.
2. **Port**:
    
    - **HTTP**: Typically uses port 80.
    - **HTTPS**: Typically uses port 443.
3. **Data Integrity**:
    
    - **HTTP**: Data can be intercepted and modified without detection.
    - **HTTPS**: Ensures data integrity through encryption and hashing, preventing unauthorized alterations.
4. **Authentication**:
    
    - **HTTP**: No inherent mechanism for verifying the identity of the server.
    - **HTTPS**: Uses digital certificates to authenticate the server, ensuring that the client is communicating with the intended server.
5. **Performance**:
    
    - **HTTP**: Slightly faster due to the absence of encryption overhead.
    - **HTTPS**: Slightly slower due to the additional time required for encryption and decryption processes.
6. **SEO and Browser Support**:
    
    - **HTTP**: Less favorable in terms of search engine ranking and browser support.
    - **HTTPS**: Preferred by search engines for ranking and required by most modern browsers for displaying a secure site indicator (padlock icon).

**Summary**
While HTTP is suitable for non-sensitive information exchange, HTTPS is essential for secure communication, ensuring that data is protected from unauthorized access and tampering. The adoption of HTTPS is now standard practice for all types of websites to provide users with a secure and trustworthy online experience.
